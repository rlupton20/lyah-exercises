# Exercises for learn you a haskell

## Introduction

### Exercise (basic)

`stack` is the preferred build tool for modern Haskell. Install it on your system and familiarize yourself with it's usage. You may also want to configure your editor for Haskell development.

## Starting out

## Exercise (basic)

Implement the fizz buzz list. If x is the i'th element of `fizzBuzz` then
  - if i is (only) divisible by 3 then x is the string `"Fizz"`; 
  - if i is (only) divisible by 5 then x is the string `"Buzz"`;
  - if i is divisible by 3 and 5 then x is the string `"FizzBuzz"`;
  - otherwise x is the string `""`;
fizzBuzz should be an infinite list. You may define it any way you please.

## Exercise (advanced)

Write an expression defining the fibonnaci sequence as an infinite list. You will want to use `tail`, `zipWith` and recursion.
